# ToDo App Example of Co-location

This app demonstrates the principles of co-location on a small scale. The organization of the source code is based on "use case," or "business case" rather than technical concern.

To run this app yourself you'll need PHP 8.2 or greater with composer, node 18 or greater, and yarn installed on your computer.

To run the app, run `./serve`.

Then in another terminal session run `./cli create-user` to add a user.

Now you can visit http://localhost:8000/todos to run the app in your browser.
